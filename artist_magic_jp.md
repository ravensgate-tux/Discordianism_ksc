## 📜 本文（日本語訳）

アーティスト・マジックの目的は、すべての創造行為を、この物質世界に働きかける魔術として機能させることにある。書くこと、描くこと、奏でること──
すべての表現は、魔術的な自己と結びつき、宇宙に向けて意志を純粋に放つものとなるべきである。私たちは、もともと魔術に似た芸術の行為を通して、
意志と物質世界をつなぐ構造を描き出すことができる。細かい筆の動きや独特のクセ、選んだ主題などには、そのアーティストとして生きる者の、最も深い個人的な秘密が表現されている。アーティストは、真実を語るために嘘をつき、嘘をつくために真実を語る──そんな矛盾を生きる存在である。アーティストが表現に魂を込めたとしても、
多くの場合には、それは変容の「金の卵」として神聖視されてしまい、芸術に不慣れな鑑賞者たちによって、ただ崇められてしまう。そのように芸術を消費する人たちにとっては、
表現とは天使や悪魔が踊り狂う舞台でしかない。芸術作品の神々は、非現実的な象徴として舞台に現れ、今ではもう意味がわからない言葉で語り合う。それは、退屈や惰性、画一性に満ちた日常の言葉とはまったく異なっている。

芸術が存在せず、それを生み出そうとする意志さえも消えた社会は、退廃してしまうだろう。芸術は人々を刺激し、人々の情熱に火をつける。お金を使いたいという欲望とは異なる深い衝動を、芸術は心の奥底に呼び起こす。Art causes wars and it also breaks them. Art speaks of love and hate in
the same way it does of one dream to another. Everything is beautifully revolting, and
equally nonsensical. The Artist creates a pastel moon garden at the edge of his own
black hole.

The creator of such a world cannot be expected to act in any other fashion than what
is seen inside his windows. The landscape blends into the sky in an explosion, and his
interactions reflect everything down to the darkest volcanic ocean bed. He may say he
is most at home in his dreams. His politic is that of spontaneous inspiration, and so
his life is also one of often intense alienation from the outside world of gray values. Not
only will Art offer one a living, but may cause the transformation of a lifetime to occur
within ones own. His universe is sanctuary to all those who would come to play with
the spirits of whimsy and insanity. The magick of art, however, performs itself by
means of a hidden layer within his world; doomed to be seen only by the artist himself.

The concept of Sigils figuratively introduced by Austin Spare gives us a point with
which to expand upon this notorious phenomenon. The tradition of creating steles,
developed by the Egyptians and utilized by the Zos Kia Cultus, among others, shows
us a framework for a magical painting. These interacting aspects of images and
meanings may be adapted to become buried within brush strokes, color combination,
line assortments, melody progression, bursts of static, and so on, given the magician
take measures to subconsciously store the required information. Artists who possess a
good amount of skill along with magical application may create viral works of immense
power to be spread worldwide among listeners, viewers and enthusiasts, much like the
Ellis works to utilize location as a form of charging the desired Sigil. It is no
coincidence that the overall success of many bands and companies had depended in
part upon their respective linking of images and logos, and there is usually an
addictive musical jingle that comes hand in hand with a corporate sigil. Both image
and sound are subconsciously routed to the same meaning. If corporations had not
been declared legal persons with a singular objective, the mechanism would be
severely faulted. McDonalds gets what McDonalds wants.

Sigils and Servitors perform due to the bypassing of conscious gaze upon
predetermined meaning. This is traditionally done by creating the Sigil out of a desire
in the form of a sentence, removing the vowels, removing repeated consonants, and
forming a pictograph from the remaining letters which is then charged while
simultaneously forgetting it’s original meaning. This method itself takes advantage of
the Zero/Infinity paradox, as both exist as recognizable things and not things at the
same time, and sometimes only within the mind.
