# Erisian Banishing Ritual (LBRP-style, Solo Version)

**Purpose:**  
To cleanse the space and set it in balance between Order and Chaos.  
(No specific banishment target — the aim is to reset the atmosphere.)

**Tools:**  
- Golden Apple (real or symbolic)  
- Ego Hammer  

---

## 1. Setting the Space
- Place the Golden Apple at the center (altar or table).  
- Stand facing **East**.  
- Hold the Ego Hammer in your dominant hand.  

---

## 2. Opening Declaration
Speak clearly, with calm authority:  
> *"In the Name of Eris, Keeper of the Balance,  
I stand between Order and Chaos.  
Let the stagnant depart,  
and the turning of the Cycle begin."*

---

## 3. Drawing the Erisian Pentacle
- Trace the **Erisian One-Stroke Pentacle** in the air with the Ego Hammer.  
- As you draw each line, vibrate inwardly or aloud:  
  > *Order*  
  > *Chaos*  
  > *Change*  
  > *Cycle*  
  > *Convergence*  

---

## 4. The Four Quarters
Move clockwise: **East → South → West → North**.  
At each quarter:  

1. Face the direction.  
2. Trace the Erisian Pentacle.  
3. Strike the table or floor lightly once with the hammer.  
4. Proclaim firmly:  
   > *"Depart, and be dissolved!"*  

---

## 5. Center Empowerment
Return to face **East**, before the Golden Apple.  
Raise the Ego Hammer high, then bring it down decisively, striking the table/floor with a **loud single blow**.  
Declare:  
> *"Hail Eris! All Hail Discordia!"*  

---

## 6. Closing
Bow your head slightly and say:  
> *"Five are One, and One is Five.  
The Circle is complete, the space is made whole."*
