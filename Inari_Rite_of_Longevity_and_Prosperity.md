# 🕯️ Inari Rite of Longevity and Prosperity (Hybrid Shinto–Western Form)
*A quiet communion within a Temporary Autonomous Zone of reverence*

---

## 🔸 Before You Begin
- **Tools**: Red cord with nine beads.  
- **Gesture**: *Vulcan mudra* (symbol of blessing and vitality).  
- **Divination**:  
  - Draw one *Crow Tarot* card before the visit (*your intent*).  
  - Draw another afterward (*Inari’s reply*).  
- **Mindset**:  
  Approach calmly, with respect and silent focus.  
  You are about to create a *Temporary Autonomous Zone (TAZ)* —  
  a sacred intersection of worlds.

## 🔸 Opening the TAZ
1. Stand still before the shrine, feet grounded, breathing steady.  
2. Slowly **turn clockwise**, becoming aware of the space around you.  
   Sense your own energy tracing the circle of your presence.  
3. When you complete the turn, **raise your hand above your head**  
   and **draw a counterclockwise circle** in the air.  
   Visualize a soft golden-red sphere descending —  
   this is the *sacred enclosure* of your working,  
   a momentary, invisible temple within the world.

## 🔸 Shinto Greeting Ritual
1. Step before the main hall (*haiden*).  
   Let the mind settle in stillness.  
2. **Bow twice**, deeply and slowly.  
   *(This opens the sacred gate.)*  
3. **Clap twice**, clearly but gracefully.  
   *(This awakens the kami and aligns your spirit.)*

## 🔸 Whispered Invocation
> ⚠️ *Note:* Unlike Western temple invocations,  
> this prayer is **not to be heard by others**.  
> Whisper softly — barely audible —  
> allowing breath, not volume, to carry intention.

> Noble **Kami of Inari**,  
> Guardian of life, harvest, and fortune,  
> I come in friendship and respect.  
> May longevity and prosperity dwell between us.  
> So mote it be.

Hold the **red cord with nine beads** in your left hand.  
Raise your right hand in the **Vulcan mudra** before your heart.  
Visualize a red-golden current linking you and the shrine,  
and think silently:  
> “Life flows through me, prosperity surrounds me, harmony abides between us.”

Finally, **bow once more** —  
closing the gate, sealing the connection.

## 🔸 Closing the TAZ
1. Step back and face the shrine one last time.  
   Whisper your thanks.  
2. Slowly **raise your hand above your head**,  
   **draw a clockwise circle**,  
   and see the red-golden sphere dissolve into the air.  
   The sacred zone returns to the ordinary world —  
   but the bond remains.  
3. Bow once again before leaving the shrine grounds.

---

## 🔸 After the Visit
Beyond the torii, stop and draw the second *Crow Tarot* card.  
This is **Inari’s voice** — a reply from the kami.  
Record both cards and your impressions in your journal.

## 🪷 Closing Reflection
> Within the quiet TAZ of Inari,  
> the red cord binds life to blessing.  
> I whispered, and the world whispered back.
